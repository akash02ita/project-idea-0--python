## language translation methods (python)

# Google Colab link
The following link will be used to do some quick tests as well

At the above link you may also see how the code and thinking has been developed.


# What does it do
This mini-project is a simple implementation of translation text from one language to a another different one.

Only functions/methods have been created to do the required tasks, so there is no graphical interface implementation yet.

# Instructions
You simply navigate to _src/translate.py_ and see the methods which do the exact thing when you "literally" read names of the methods.

Type hints have been given to help understand the code more easily.

Note: **sl_language** and **tl_language** mean, respectively, **_source language_** and **_translate language_**


# Sources
The following sources were used which aided in figuring out that "translate.google.com/m" does not have problems of returning translated text after an HTTPS request compared to "translate.google.com"
